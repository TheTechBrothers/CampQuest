Absolutely, in the context of Firebase and most databases, the "Data Type" refers to the type of each field within a document. It can be a string, boolean, number, timestamp, map (object), array, etc. The "Collection" in the previous table refers to the way Firebase organizes data at a higher level, which is different from the data types of the individual fields.

Here's an updated version of the data dictionary with specific data types for the fields within each document:

| Collection         | Document ID    | Field            | Description                                      | Data Type     | Use Case IDs |

For Firebase and many other NoSQL databases, `Timestamp` is a common data type used to represent dates and times. It's important to note that the Firebase Realtime Database does not have a native `Timestamp` type, but Firebase Firestore does. If you're using the Realtime Database, you would typically store dates and times as strings or numbers (e.g., UNIX epoch time).

Maps (objects) and arrays can be used to store structured data, where a map contains key-value pairs and an array is a list of items. For instance, `ContactDetails` might be a map containing keys like `email`, `phone`, etc. 

Qualifications could be an array of maps, where each map contains information about one qualification such as the `CourseName` and `Grade`.

This structure should be flexible enough to accommodate the various use cases you've outlined, while also being efficient for the types of queries you'll run against your Firebase database.
